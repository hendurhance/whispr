## What is Whispr?
Whispr is an open-source alternative to anonymous Q&A apps like NGL, Sarahah, or Kubool, built with privacy and security in mind. It allows users to create a personal profile and share a unique link to receive anonymous messages from others. People can send questions, feedback, compliments, confessions, or any message completely anonymously through the link, and the recipient can read them in their Whispr dashboard. Whispr‚Äôs goal is to provide a fun and safe environment for honest communication, while respecting user privacy.

## Features
- **Anonymous Messages**: Receive messages or questions from anyone without knowing the sender‚Äôs identity. Supports various categories of messages such as Q&A, compliments, advice, opinions, confessions, and more.
- **Personal Link**: Every user gets a unique shareable link (e.g.` https://trywhispr.me/<yourUsername>`) that others can use to send them messages
- **Customizable Profile**: Users can choose theme colors, add a profile picture, and write a short bio to personalize their profile
- **Dashboard & Filters**: Logged-in users have a dashboard to view all incoming ‚Äúwhisprs.‚Äù Messages can be filtered by type (question, confession, compliment, etc.) and marked as read/unread for better organization
- **Password-less Login**: Easy account creation via passwordless email magic link
- **Random Prompts**: A fun ‚Äúdice‚Äù feature provides random pre-written questions or prompts for senders who aren‚Äôt sure what to ask
- **Privacy Controls**: Only the intended recipient can read the messages they receive ‚Äì senders remain anonymous. Sender metadata (like IP address) is encrypted and not exposed to the recipient, ensuring privacy while still allowing abuse prevention if needed
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, mobile-friendly web interface built with a modern tech stack (React + Tailwind CSS) for a smooth user experience.

## üíª Tech Stack
Whispr‚Äôs front-end is built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel for hosting. It uses Supabase (a Backend-as-a-Service) for its entire back-end needs and edge functions to handle server-side logic. The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

- **React & TypeScript**: For building a dynamic single-page application with robust, maintainable code (leveraging static typing)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent design.
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL database + Auth + Storage)**: Handles user authentication, data persistence, and file storage. This replaces a custom server/backend ‚Äì all data operations and authentication are done via Supabase‚Äôs secure APIs
- **Vercel**: Hosts the front-end, providing easy deployment and scaling. The app can be accessed publicly (and via the demo link above) without any server setup.

> **Why these technologies**? I chose a monolithic React front-end for simplicity and ease of development given the project‚Äôs scope. Using Supabase for the back-end greatly speeds up development by offloading infrastructure, security, and scaling concerns to a reliable service. This way, we focus on building features rather than reinventing the wheel for authentication or database management. The Atomic Design pattern is used in the front-end codebase to keep components modular and maintainable (see [Technical Specifications](/doc/technical-specifications.md) for more details).

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up a local development environment for Whispr.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed/setup on your system:
- Git ‚Äì for cloning the repository.
- Node.js (v21 or above recommended) ‚Äì JavaScript runtime.
- Yarn (or npm) ‚Äì for installing dependencies.
- Supabase account ‚Äì You‚Äôll need a Supabase project to use as the back-end (sign up at supabase.com). In the project, obtain your Supabase API URL and anon API key for the next step

### Installation
1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hendurhance/whispr.git
   cd whispr
   ```
2. **Install NPM packages**
   ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
    Or
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. **Configure environment variables**: Create a `.env` from `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables
   ```sh
   cp .env.local .env
    ```
    Then add the following variables
    ```sh
    NODE_ENV=local
    VITE_APP_URL=localhost:3000
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase_url>
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase_anon_key>
    VITE_SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=<supabase_functions_url>
    ```
4. **Run the app**
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
    Or
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
  This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.
5. **Setup Supabase**: In your Supabase project, create the following tables:
   - Use the `/ migrations/init.sql` file to create the necessary tables and functions in your Supabase database. You can run this SQL script in the SQL editor of your Supabase project.
   - **Setup Edge Functions**: In your Supabase project, navigate to the "Functions" section and create a new function that uses the functions created in the `/ migrations/init.sql` file. This function will handle incoming messages and store them in the database. The edge functions include:
     * `update-profile-views`: This function handles updating the profile views count in the database.
     * `update-whispr-counts`: This function handles updating the whispr counts in the database.
     * `submit-whispr`: This function handles submitting a new message to the database. It uses the SQL function `submit_anonymous_whispr` to insert the whispr into the database.
     * `delete-user`: This function handles deleting a user from the database. Due to Supabase's security policies, you need to create a edge function to delete a user from the database.
6. **Create an account on Whispr:** Once the app is running locally, click Sign Up and create an account. You can sign up with an email (you‚Äôll receive a magic login link). After your first login, you‚Äôll be prompted to choose a username for your profile link.
7. Set up your profile link: After signing up, Whispr will associate your chosen username with a personal link (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/<username>` for local dev, or `trywhispr.me/<username>` in production)
github.com. Share this link with friends or on social media so others can send you anonymous messages!
9. Test sending/receiving messages: Try opening your profile link in an incognito browser (or have a friend open it). You‚Äôll see a message submission page where anyone can send you a Whispr anonymously. Submit a test message. Then, log back into your account and check your dashboard ‚Äì the message should appear there, along with any metadata like the type of message and timestamp.
> Happy Hacking! You now have Whispr running locally. Feel free to explore the code, tweak features, or contribute improvements. For a deep dive into the architecture and design of Whispr, see the Technical Specifications document.

## üí¨ Usage Example
Scenario: _You want to gather honest feedback and fun messages from your friends. Here‚Äôs how you can use Whispr:_
- Sign Up & Get Your Link: Register on Whispr (using the demo or your deployed instance) and create a unique username. For example, if you choose alex, your anonymous message link will be `trywhispr.me/alex`. This link is displayed on your dashboard.
- **Share the Link**: Post your Whispr link on social platforms or send it directly to friends. Invite people to ‚Äúsend me anything ‚Äì anonymously.‚Äù
**Receive Messages**: Others can click your link and be taken to the Whispr submission page for your profile. They do not need to log in or reveal who they are. They can select a category (question, compliment, confession, etc.), type a message, and send it completely anonymously
**Read and Respond**: When someone sends you a message, it gets saved to the database with no identifying information about the sender (aside from hidden metadata). You can respond by sharing the message or downloading it as an image. You will get an image like this:
  > ![Screenshot 5](/doc/images/whispr.png)

You can log into Whispr and see the new message on your dashboard. New messages are marked as unread. You might choose to respond to these messages publicly by sharing them (outside the app), or just keep the feedback privately.
**Manage Your Whisprs**: In your dashboard, you can filter messages by type (e.g., only show compliments) and sort them by date received or other criteria. This helps in managing a large number of incoming whisprs. You can also mark messages as read, or delete any message that is inappropriate.

This simple flow allows for open communication ‚Äì you get honest messages, and senders get the freedom of anonymity. Whispr‚Äôs design ensures that while messages are anonymous to users, there are protections behind the scenes to prevent abuse (like rate limiting and encrypted tracking of submissions).
